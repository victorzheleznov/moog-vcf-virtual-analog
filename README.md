# Virtual analog models of Moog VCF

This repository contains two scripts for simulation of nonlinear Moog VCF circuit:
1. `moog_vcf_adaa.m` —  state-space model with use of antiderivative antialiasing method.
2. `moog_vcf_phs.m` —  Port Hamiltonian model.

All of the relevant references are provided within MATLAB scripts.
